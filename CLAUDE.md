# LangLearn HTML Recreation Project

## Goal
Help recreate the language learning page represented by the model files. The focus is on learning by doing - walking through each step methodically to understand HTML structure, CSS integration, JavaScript functionality, and best practices.

## Reference Files
- `model.html` - Complete reference implementation
- `main.css` - CSS starting point with utilities and variables
- `model.css` - Full styling reference
- `model.js` - JavaScript functionality reference with carousel, navigation, and touch interactions

## Target Files to Create
- `home.html` - Our recreation of the model page
- `app.js` - Our JavaScript implementation based on model.js

## Step-by-Step Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ…
- [x] Created CLAUDE.md for tracking progress
- [x] Analyzed model.html structure, main.css utilities, and model.js functionality

### Phase 2: HTML Structure (In Progress)
- [ ] Create home.html with basic document structure
- [ ] Build bottom navigation footer first (5 nav buttons with SVG icons)
- [ ] Add header with title and hamburger menu button
- [ ] Create main content sections (carousel, stats grid, vocabulary grid)
- [ ] Add sidebar navigation for desktop
- [ ] Test HTML structure

### Phase 3: JavaScript Implementation
- [ ] Create app.js based on model.js
- [ ] Implement carousel functionality with scroll snap
- [ ] Add navigation switching logic
- [ ] Create load more functionality
- [ ] Add touch interactions and ripple effects

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Link main.css and app.js to home.html
- [ ] Test responsive navigation
- [ ] Validate mobile-first approach
- [ ] Check animation utilities
- [ ] Test all JavaScript interactions

### Phase 5: Final Validation
- [ ] Check for best practices compliance
- [ ] Test accessibility features
- [ ] Validate touch targets (44px minimum)
- [ ] Commit final version

## Key Learning Points
1. Mobile-first responsive design
2. CSS custom properties (variables)
3. Utility class methodology
4. Semantic HTML structure
5. Touch-friendly navigation with ripple effects
6. Carousel with scroll snap and intersection observer
7. Performance optimizations (lazy loading, debouncing)

## JavaScript Features to Understand
- Carousel with smooth scroll and dots navigation
- Bottom navigation with active states
- Sidebar with overlay and escape key handling
- Touch interactions with ripple effects
- Intersection Observer for performance
- Auto-advance carousel with pause on interaction

## Commit Strategy
Commit after each major component completion with descriptive messages focusing on what functionality was added.
